- ### Button: Additional Enhancements
  Adds additional site editor enhancements to Button plugin including:
  - Adding extra padding to expand the clickable area within CKEditor to allow easier click-to-edit on the button element within the editor view. Previously it was difficult to click-to-edit on small and regular button elements within the editor. Buttons rendered on page will have the traditional amount of padding.
  - Button's toolbar icon toggles on/off when editing
  
  
  Resolves #19

- ### Fixes bug with Button links not persisting in UI upon return editing, before page save
  Resolves #18 - Button link persists through multiple edits before the full page is saved. Previously the provided link would get removed from UI if needing to re-enter the editing UI before page save.
  
  Also swaps the 'watch' build for the final build version of button

- ### Adds CKEditor 'Button' Plugin to CKEditor

- ### Adds Map plugin for embedding Campus Maps
  This update adds the Map plugin to CKEditor, which allows a content editor to provide a link shared from the [CU Boulder Campus Map](https://www.colorado.edu/map/) and embeds a map widget on a page. Just as in the [CKEditor 4 Shortcode](https://websupport.colorado.edu/article/425-campus-map-shortcode) there are three size options to choose from for the widget. The Map plugin outputs web component-like syntax for easier migration and future changes (see `README.md` for the schemas). Resolves CuBoulder/ucb_ckeditor_plugins#13
  
  This update also includes a couple miscellaneous changes:
  - Renames JavaScript package
  - Refactors Box plugin (no changes to functionality)
