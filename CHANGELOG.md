## [Unreleased]

- ### Adds Map plugin for embedding Campus Maps
  This update adds the Map plugin to CKEditor, which allows a content editor to provide a link shared from the [CU Boulder Campus Map](https://www.colorado.edu/map/) and embeds a map widget on a page. Just as in the [CKEditor 4 Shortcode](https://websupport.colorado.edu/article/425-campus-map-shortcode) there are three size options to choose from for the widget. The Map plugin outputs web component-like syntax for easier migration and future changes (see `README.md` for the schemas). Resolves CuBoulder/ucb_ckeditor_plugins#13
  
  This update also includes a couple miscellaneous changes:
  - Renames JavaScript package
  - Refactors Box plugin (no changes to functionality)
  
  CuBoulder/tiamat-theme#258
